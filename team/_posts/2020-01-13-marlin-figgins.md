I'm a research assistant in the Bedford lab. I am primarily interested in infectious disease ecology and in particular, how various spatial structure and heterogeneities affect disease transmission. I am very excited to continue exploring these interests in the Bedford lab, focusing on the role of spatial elements in influenza dynamics and forecasting.
